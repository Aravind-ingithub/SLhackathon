# Building a Personalized Fashion Recommendation System
If you are someone who always spends too much time thinking and feeling kind of anxious about What shoud I Wear? Did you ever think how much better it would be to have a personalized recommendation system just for you, So that all you got to do is open a mobile app and enter the occasion you are going to and the model will predict and pick the most suitable dress out of all the dresses you have which will be apt for that specific occasion. 
1. The Idea is to create a model that has trained with most of the best rated fashion dress and style images that can be worn for various occasions, here occasion being the target label.
2. The second thing is uploading the dress material photos that every user have to their localized model's cloud storage.
3. Now the model will calculate the prediction comparing the users bag of dresses and rates the number of dresses in a ranking order of high to low. 
4. And then it recommends the rated dresses to the user, allow him/her to make their decision based on the model results.
5. We can extend this model idea on to a different field by training it with a database of books of differenet generes and then building a customized book recommendation.
